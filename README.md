# stock-analysis
Backing up VBA stock analysis work.

# Overview
*Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a refactored version of the stock analysis. This entails reformatting the original code with a single for loop so the code can run through the stock information more efficiently. The code is meant to collect data from 12 different companies. This data includes the 12 ticker variables, the issue dates of the stocks for 2017 and 2018, the price at opening, the highest and lowest price, the closing price and the adjusted closing price as well as the volume of the stock. With this information we were able to calculate the total daily volume and the return on investment from each company for each year. 

# Analysis
*Findings
Because the purpose was just to refactor the code the first step was to copy and paste the original code into a new sub and change the information so it could fit in to a single for loop. You can observe the refactored codes below.

*Summary
Refactoring the code definitely had advantages such as creating more readable and easy to comprehend code. The refactoring down to one for loop allows for faster run time as it is not looping through more than once. The run time for both years now runs three times faster. Some disadvantages of refactoring the code was simply time. Refactoring while it helps maintain and keep the code up to date, it also could hinder your time. If you change something and it doesnâ€™t work then it can be hard to get back to the original outcome. The original code also allowed for the same results as the new code. If something does go wrong it can be hard to find your footing again and this definitely happened when refactoring.
